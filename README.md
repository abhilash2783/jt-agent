- Receives webhooks from Teams and Jira, relays/transforms as needed
- No database or paid infra required

## Setup
1. **Clone & install:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd jt-agent
   npm install
   ```
2. **Configure:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set secrets/URLs as needed.
3. **Run locally:**
